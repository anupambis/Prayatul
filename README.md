# Instructions:

To evaluate performance of two machine learning algorithmns, you just need to replace three input arguments of Prayatul Matrix generating function generatePrayatulMatrix (G,P,Q).
    
     1) G : Ground truth labels of all test samples in the dataset 
     2) P : Predicted labels obtained with primary algorithm 
     3) Q : Predicted labels obtained with alternative algorithm
